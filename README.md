# Connect 4 Adversarial Search

An intelligent Connect 4 agent powered by Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms. This project implements adversarial search techniques and decision tree evaluation to demonstrate strategic gameplay and optimization through pruning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project provides a comprehensive educational implementation of game theory algorithms applied to Connect 4. It demonstrates the difference between exhaustive Minimax search and optimized Alpha-Beta pruning, showing detailed decision trees and terminal state analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Complete implementation with full tree exploration
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimized search with branch elimination
- **Detailed Visualization**: Step-by-step algorithm execution display
- **Tree Analysis**: Complete decision tree visualization and terminal state summaries
- **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of both algorithms
- **Educational Output**: Comprehensive logging of algorithm decisions and pruning actions

## ðŸŽ® Game Configuration

### Board Setup
- **Dimensions**: 6 rows Ã— 7 columns (standard Connect 4)
- **Initial State**: Partially filled board with predetermined pieces
- **Restricted Play**: Limited to first 3 columns only (columns 0, 1, 2)
- **Search Depth**: Configurable (default: 3 levels)

### Players
- **MAX Player (X)**: Maximizing player (value +1)
- **MIN Player (O)**: Minimizing player (value -1)
- **Alternating Turns**: MAX starts, then MIN, then MAX, etc.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms

### Minimax Algorithm
- **Complete Search**: Explores all possible game states
- **Recursive Evaluation**: Evaluates all terminal nodes
- **Perfect Play**: Assumes both players play optimally
- **Value Propagation**: Propagates values up the tree (max/min selection)

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Optimized Search**: Eliminates unnecessary branches
- **Alpha-Beta Windows**: Maintains search bounds
- **Pruning Detection**: Cuts branches when Î± â‰¥ Î²
- **Same Result**: Guarantees identical outcome to Minimax with fewer evaluations
